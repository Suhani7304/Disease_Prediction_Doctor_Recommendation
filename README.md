# Disease Prediction and Doctor Recommendation System

This project is designed to help users predict diseases based on symptoms and recommend doctors for treatment. It leverages machine learning models to provide accurate predictions and recommendations, making it easier for users to seek timely medical advice.

### Project Overview
Our system helps users by:
1️⃣ Predicting the top 5 most probable diseases based on symptoms, along with probability percentages.
2️⃣ Providing detailed descriptions and precautions for the most probable disease.
3️⃣ Recommending top doctors for the predicted disease based on their experience, patient ratings, and location.
4️⃣ Allowing users to directly search for doctors based on a specific disease and location.
